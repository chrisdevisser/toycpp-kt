File ending in backslash ([lex.phases]/2)
    Should there be an implicit newline in this case so this is a line splice?
    MSVC: yes
    Clang, GCC: no
    Thoughts: The wording seems like yes, but the intent seems like no.

Raw string literal as include
    MSVC: Compiles
    Clang, GCC: Fails
    Thoughts: It's UB because it doesn't match the grammar of the other productions.

Raw string literal as import
    Clang: Treats as import directive, expects header name
    GCC: Treats as text line
    MSVC: Treats as import directive, compiles
    Thoughts: Ultimately UB again. The line is an import directive and the raw string is a string-literal token, but then gets relexed into a header-name token the same way as in a #include and doesn't match either of the two productions.
