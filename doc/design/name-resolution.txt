Name resolution occurs via a symbol table organized by scope. The symbol table is built while parsing and used to do full resolution as names are used. Many lookups search outward, but ADL is one notable example where other scopes are considered as well. Two-phase lookup is particularly notable because ordinary dependent names are looked up relative to the template definition, but ADL can find declarations past the template definition. In order to work in this model, name lookup for dependent names has to happen while parsing the template definition. These results are saved for use during instantiation.
