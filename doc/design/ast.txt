Literals

Literals have some leeway with how they're represented. For example, hexadecimal and binary literals have the same value as decimal literals, but a difference in spelling. The base is not preserved in the AST node.

Names

Not all names are equal. Qualified names, member accesses, and template specializations are deliberately kept as simple as possible to avoid a big headache when using the final AST.
